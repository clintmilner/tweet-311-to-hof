They‚Äôve wrote the majority of their own songs but have done an amazing job on many cover songs. They have not lost sight of who they are even as they‚Äôve matured as a band & individually. They motivate & inspire so many people & are also positively influential with many things that all people need to understand & be aware of to help choose to support s cause or take a stance something that matters. They have remained together after all of this time & are as energetic to watch as they were when they were much younger. They are deserving of this recognition as they have the upmost respect from fans, celebrities, musicians, & anyone who has got the chance to listen or know of them. They are hard working & have a discography that is overflowing with both hits & cult classics & fan favorites - many that may speak personally to a fan, many that have allowed fans to know & understand these 5 talented artists. They never let down their fans & rarely take a break from touring or recording. If you have seen 311‚Äôs videos - they are amazing & timeless. If you have seen them play live, you most likely would see them again & agree with my description of them, & if you haven‚Äôt - please do! Anyone with an appreciation of music from rock to raggae to hip to rap to even punk or pop music will find many songs to nod your heads to their lyrics & amazing beats. 311 & unity go hand in hand.\" -Layla D. from Texas",

    "title": "\"These guys not only have been around for almost 3 decades, but have also stayed together with the same lineup! A very rare accomplishment for any band in any decade. They have their own holiday that is recognized by the city of New Orleans, have their own cruise that ships off every two years, are easily one of the best live performances you will probably ever see. They stay true to themselves while evolving their art, and are humble, good guys who appreciate their fans endlessly, both old and new. The community around these guys is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever been apart of and will say that no other can stand with it. They are still going strong and will probably continue for many years to come. They promote positivity, unity and respect, which is something that the industry has very much lost sight of these days. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a question of why they should be inducted, but rather, I feel one would find it more difficult to find a reason why they shouldn‚Äôt be. 311 for the hall of fame, no doubt about it.

They do so much for their fans as well whether it be 3/11 days or in my case a dedication to a friend that had passed away at a show. 14 years ago my friend passed away that was a fellow 311 fan, we had been to a bunch of shows together. We had tickets to a show and ge had passes before it. A big group of friends and family ended going to the show anyways 10 days after he had passed. My friend had won a meet and greet with them and they heard our story and played their song entitled \"Tribute \" to him. It made me the biggest fan from there on out. Ive been to a total of 38 311 shows since and tget always put on an amazing show, they never disappoint. Their latest album is one of my favorites and its amazing to me that they are still going strong\" -Andy T. from Massachusetts",
