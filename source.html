                    has one of the most impressive presences in the music world. Together,
                    with all 5 original members for 29 years now, 311 is still going hard
                    and putting on endless tours, events and festivals to keep the vibe and
                    rocking going with their colossal fan base. 311 radiates positivity in
                    to their fans lives. Legions of fans world wide travel to amazing places
                    to take part in the phenomenon that is 311. To 311 cruises and 311 Day,
                    this group of men has single handedly created a holiday for their fans
                    where they pay US homage. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>311 is one of those bands who not only cares for their fans but makes
                        them a part of their lives. After live shows, you can catch them by the
                        tour buses where they are there simply to connect with "The
                        Excitables". Pictures, laughs and memories are made and that simple kind
                        gesture has set them aside from the rest. They network with their fans
                        on social media, including us on various projects such as the cover art
                        for their last album, Mosaic. There is a togetherness that 311 brings to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>These 5 men are hard working and and inspirational and steadily
                        finding new ways to exude their natural, God given talents. Every show
                        is met with a new playlist. Every show. the devotion that they put into
                        their music, performances and presence is unmatched by any. They are the
                        fourth longest running band for a reason. The passion and genius that
                        is 311 is far beyond worthy of an accolade such as being inducted into
                        the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. As 311 said in their song Too Late, "at
                        the end of the day, the relentless always win". That is the whole vibe
                        of 311. Never quit. Never stop. Believe in yourself. Stay Positive and
                        Love your Life.</p>
                    <p>Lets get these immensely talented men inducted in to the Rock and
                        Roll Hall of Fame as a HUGE THANK YOU to the love and unity that they
                        have brought into millions of our lives!!</p></div>
